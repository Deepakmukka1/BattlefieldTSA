# Battlefield High School Webmaster Competition

This repository holds a static website, consisting of three webpages, each built with HTML, CSS, and the Bootstrap framework. The contents consist of one page for Battlefield High School's Technology Student Association chapter (see [history](#history)), another for Battlefield High School's Career and Technical Education program, and a third for a fictional band invented by the chapter.

## Current Goals

Despite utilizing the Bootstrap framework, much of the website remains nonresponsive. Currently, work is being undergone to resolve the issue, and to fix some of the other UI problems sprinkled throughout. Upon completion, work will begin to incorporate [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) into the project.

## History

This website is the submission of Battlefield High School in the Virginia Technology Student Association 2019 Webmaster Competition. It was created over the course of the 2018-2019 academic year, and in May of 2019, was awarded first place by a collection of judges. Eventually, it was placed on this repository, where it remained dormant until July of 2020, when development rebegun to create an overall more satisfying product.
